  Hello, my name is Andr√© Gottgtroy. I am a passionate game designer with a love for creating worlds and experiences, one mechanic at a time.

  I am currently working as a general game designer.

  Below, you can find my professional and hobby game development work, as well as my game design blog. 

about:  |
  I was born in Brazil, but grew up in New Zealand. Currently living in Auckland, NZ.

  I have always had a deep fascination with history, especially ancient history, myths, legends, and novels. Moving cultures early in my life only heightened it. I found that the stories that come from these always help to give a deeper understanding of the people telling and listening to them.

  My love of games originated from this, as I initially discovered games through the Age of Empires series, the Baldur's Gate series, and Harvest Moon, where their storytelling of history and fantasy sparked a strong passion in me.

  All manner of games have shaped my life, from sports I love and still play, teaching me creativity, teamwork, determination, and compromise, to board games and role-playing games, which taught me essential social skills, and video games that helped me learn English. Because of this, I foster a deep passion for games and sharing them with others.

  My friends and family will be the first to say I can always find a way to bring anyone into becoming a gamer, whether it is a board game, role-playing game, a sport, or a video game; some might say my vast collection of physical board games is even a little too much - they lie, there can never be enough.

  After maturing and learning more about how games are made, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, specializing in game development. Now, having a child of my own, my drive for creating immersive, incredible experiences that will hopefully inspire others, just as I have been, has only grown stronger. If not to inspire, then to allow any and all to share in the wonderful experience that it is to play and truly enjoy a game.

  After all, everyone should have even a little spark of fun and joy in their lives.
