This post is a complete demonstration of all the features available in the blog. You can use this file as a template for your own posts!

### This is a Heading (H3)

You can write standard paragraphs of text. You can make text **bold** or *italic* to add emphasis. This is perfect for explaining your design process, the challenges you faced, and the solutions you came up with.

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting a key takeaway or a quote that inspired you during development.

Here is an example of a list:
* **Prototyping:** The first and most crucial step.
* **Art & Assets:** Creating the visual style of the game.
* **Systems Design:** Building the core rules and mechanics.

### Displaying Media

You have three powerful ways to show off your game visually.

First, you can embed a **single image** anywhere in the post, like this concept art for a new card design.

Second, by adding a `videoId` to the frontmatter at the top of this file, the website will automatically embed a **YouTube video trailer**. This is perfect for showing gameplay in action.

And finally, by adding a `screenshots` list to the frontmatter, the website will generate an **auto-sliding image gallery**, which is great for showcasing multiple in-game moments or UI designs.
