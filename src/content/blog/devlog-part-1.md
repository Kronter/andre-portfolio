Starting a new personal project is always exciting! This week, I've been prototyping the core movement system for a new 2D adventure game. Using simple shapes, I'm focusing entirely on nailing the physics and responsiveness before any art is created. It's all about building a solid foundation.

This initial phase is crucial for ensuring the final game feels great to play. A lot of developers jump straight into art, but I find that a focus on mechanics first pays off immensely in the long run.
