As the lead on Project Nebula, I spearheaded the design of the procedural galaxy generation system, ensuring billions of unique star systems could be explored. I also wrote the main questline and designed the branching dialogue system using a proprietary node-based editor.

A major challenge was balancing the ship combat to be accessible for new players while offering depth for veterans.
