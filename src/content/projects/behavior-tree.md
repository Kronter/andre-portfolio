This tool is made to help visualize and create a better work flow for the Behavior tree I created for the ***District Underground*** project.

The behaviour tree originally was code only, so I felt the need to crerate a tool, to better visualize and debug its structure.

**Engine:** Unity tool

**Main Features:**
 [INDENT]◦ Behaviour tree contructor and visualizer
◦ Real time flow viewer and debugger
◦ Scriptable object base for tree, actions and nodes
◦ Easily transferable between projects [/INDENT]
