***Outfire*** is a top down shooter with MOBA elements with various gamemodes including Battle Royal and team based modes.

**â€‹Responsibilities:**
My primary role was to overhaul the user interface to improve player onboarding and readability during intense combat. I conducted user testing sessions to identify pain points and iterated on HUD layouts in Figma.

The final design increased player retention by 15% in the first week post-launch.
