***Hublix*** is a Cozy social driven game where players meet, talk, play and create new friends in social and private hubs of their own designs.

**Engine:** Unreal Engine
**Genre(s):** Casual, Cozy, Social
**Platform(s):** PC, Ios, Android

**Responsibilities:**
*This was my first project as a professional game designer and so I began it as a* ***Junior Designer*** *I progressed through to a* ***Intermidiate Designer*** *during this project, along with becoming a* ***Deputy Lead Designer*** *and a*  ***Lead Designer***.

*I led a team of 6 other game designers along with mentoring 2 of them*

◦ ***R&D Designer:*** 
The project was a fairly experimental project and required a lot of prototypes and R&D, as the first game designer on this project, all these responsibilities fell on me.
I came up with, presented and prototyped game and feature ideas with my team and CEOs. Researched market trends and, when needed, designed innovations with a small team of programmers.
During this time, I led multiple teams of programmers on multiple different prototype projects as the sole designer.

◦ ***General Designer:*** 
Once the project had entered production I became a more general game designer, working on all areas of the project, from level design, UI/UX, 3Cs, gameplay, social, to meta and more.
As the original designer in the project, I made sure we kept to the main vision & pillars of the project, and that all systems and mechanics integrated cohesively into the general design.

◦ ***Creative Producer:*** 
I was eventually made into a Deputy producer, focusing on being a creative producer, for the project.
While in this role I still continued to also act as a game designer.
I was focused on working with the sound, game design and art teams making sure the scheduale was correct, the teams work flow was smooth, on time, and followed the projects main vision.
