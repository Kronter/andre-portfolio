This tool was created for the ***District Underground*** project, used to query the environment for data. That data was then used to provide the AI with data used in the decision-making process on how to proceed, and postion.

I based this tool on the Unreal engine tool of the same name *(as unity did not have this tool available)*.

**Engine:** Unity tool

**Main Features:**
[INDENT]◦ Enviroment data query
◦ Visual indication of queried data and test outcomes
◦ Swapable and scriptable data tests
◦ Adjustable query point shapes
◦ Adjustable query point density
◦ Togglable height adjustment *(for terrain with different heights)* [/INDENT]

**Use case examples:**
[INDENT]◦ Combat positioning: for back stab/ganking, always being in front of player, best postion for specific attacks.
◦ General positioning: for staying in cover, always being in the players line of sight or outside of cover, hiding.[/INDENT]
