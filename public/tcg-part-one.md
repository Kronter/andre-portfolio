     My family especially my partner and I play a lot of board games, but I have always wanted to get them more involved with TCGs especially my partner. 
     She is very good with complexity in games and does not shy away from it, so that has never been the problem. 
     
     However, she is not a big fan of games where you activily have to fight another person, it's just not really the vibe she likes, she will play some board games like this especially ones, that are not 1 v 1, but she prefers games where the player on player interaction comes from more indirect means and strategies, or coorporation. 
     
     There are some TCGs that touch on one or two of these points such as Altered TCG and Lorecana.
     But these just don't quite hit the sweet spot with how we want to play.

     The rest of my family also usually need a gradual introduction to more complex games than what most TCGs offer.

     I have always played and been fascinated by card games, both just standard board games that are card games and trading card games.

     But trading card games in particular have an extra aespect to them that sets them apart from their single box contained cousins; the need to think more deeply about future sets, how these sets will all synergize well together without breaking the whole game, how to initially design the game in a way that you do not close off any future design space, and at the same time making sure you keep your sets concise, themed and small as to not have too many mechanics *(in other words how to control the sets scope)*

     So I see designing a TCG as an interesting exercise on various important areas of game design that are cruicial for any game designer to maintain and improve on, and so am taking the opportunity to do exactly that.

     I have a desire to make an interesting resource system, that  adds strategic depth, is easy to understand, has a nice fluidity to it, and does not hamper gameplay. 
     Although Magic's mana system is the most classic and for the most part simplest, and I understand that Magic's mana flood is meant to be a good catch up mechanic, I think it is far from the best design.

     I see some very elegant solutions from various games: 
     
     **Lorecana & Altered TCG:**
     [INDENT]all/most cards in your deck being the resouces, giving you and interesting strategic choice on which cards to keep, which to play and which to exchange into a resource, helping with a lot of the awkward early game large cost pulls that can happen.[/INDENT]
     
     **Flesh and Blood:**
     [INDENT]pitch system that gives all cards more use and huge strategic depth in the game play having players think about the order the pitch cards for future turns.[/INDENT]

     **One Piece TCG:** *(and by proxy the other bandi TCGs)*
     [INDENT]multi use resource system with using resources to both pay and buff cards creates a fun interesting fluidity to the game, and although simple does add more strategic depth.[/INDENT]

     There are many other type of interesting resource systems, like sorcery contested realms, or dual masters but these were the main stand outs for me, and what brought me to want to challenge my self.

     Although I will fully act as if I am designing this TCG to be fully published, that is not my goal.

     Really my goal is to improve my Game Design skills through this exercise and hopefully have something fun I can have to play with my close family and friends.
     Possibily as a cube of some sort, and maybe who knows *(although very unlikely)* it could be good enough to think about publishing.
